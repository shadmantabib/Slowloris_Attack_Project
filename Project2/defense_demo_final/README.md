```

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**
- **Target Server**: Visit http://localhost:3000 (should show server status page)
- **Attack Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:4000 (should show control interface)

## 📖 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### **Phase 1: Understanding the Baseline (2 minutes)**

1. **Open the Dashboard**
   - Go to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser
   - You'll see the control interface with real-time metrics

2. **Observe Normal Server Performance**
   - **Response Time**: Should be around 100-200ms (normal)
   - **Success Rate**: Should be 100% (all requests succeed)
   - **Protection Status**: Shows "🔓 VULNERABLE" (no defenses active)

3. **Test the Target Server**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in another tab
   - Page should load quickly (under 1 second)
   - This represents a normal, healthy web server

### **Phase 2: Launch the Attack (3 minutes)**

1. **Start the Slowloris Attack**
   - Click the **"Launch Slowloris Attack"** button
   - Attack Status changes to "ATTACKING"
   - You'll see "🎯 Slowloris attack started" in the event log

2. **Watch the Impact in Real-Time**
   - **Response Time**: Spikes to 5000-10000ms (extremely slow)
   - **Success Rate**: Drops to 20-50% (many requests fail)
   - **Charts**: Show dramatic performance degradation
   - **Target Server**: Try visiting http://localhost:3000 - it will be very slow or timeout

3. **Understand What's Happening**
   - The attack script opened 50 slow connections to the server
   - These connections consume server resources without completing
   - Normal users can't get through because resources are exhausted
   - This is exactly how real Slowloris attacks work

### **Phase 3: Enable Protection (The Magic Moment!) (2 minutes)**

1. **Toggle Protection While Attack is Running**
   - Click the **"Toggle Protection"** button
   - Protection Status changes to "🛡️ PROTECTED"
   - Watch the **immediate improvement** in metrics!

2. **Observe the Defense in Action**
   - **Response Time**: Drops back to 100-300ms (nearly normal!)
   - **Success Rate**: Recovers to 90-100% (defenses working!)
   - **Target Server**: http://localhost:3000 loads normally again
   - **Charts**: Show dramatic recovery

3. **Understand What Just Happened**
   - Server enabled connection limits (max 100 connections)
   - Enabled request timeouts (5 seconds max)
   - Attack connections are automatically terminated
   - Normal users can access the server again

### **Phase 4: Test Defense Effectiveness (3 minutes)**

1. **Toggle Protection On/Off**
   - Click "Toggle Protection" again to disable it
   - Watch metrics immediately degrade (attack becomes effective again)
   - Click "Toggle Protection" to re-enable protection
   - Watch metrics immediately improve

2. **Adjust Defense Settings**
   - Try different **Max Connections** (10, 50, 100, 200)
   - Adjust **Request Timeout** (1, 5, 10, 30 seconds)
   - Enable/disable **Rate Limiting**
   - See how each setting affects defense effectiveness

3. **Stop the Attack**
   - Click **"Stop Attack"** when finished
   - Server returns to completely normal operation
   - All metrics return to baseline levels

## 🔍 Understanding the Components

### **Target Server (target_server.py)**

**What it is:** A Flask web application that simulates a real website.

**What it does:**
- **Serves web pages** like any normal website
- **Tracks performance** (response times, success/failure rates)
- **Implements defense mechanisms** when protection is enabled
- **Provides an API** for the dashboard to monitor and control it

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic Protection**: Can enable/disable defenses without restarting
- **Real-time Stats**: Tracks every request and its outcome
- **Connection Tracking**: Monitors how many connections are active
- **Vulnerable Mode**: Simulates how unprotected servers behave

### **Attack Dashboard (attack_dashboard.py)**

**What it is:** A web-based control center for managing attacks and defenses.

**What it does:**
- **Launches attacks** against the target server
- **Monitors performance** in real-time with live charts
- **Controls protection** mechanisms on the target server
- **Displays live events** and system status

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Charts**: Shows response times and success rates over time
- **Protection Controls**: Toggle defenses and adjust settings
- **Attack Management**: Start/stop attacks with one click
- **Live Monitoring**: Updates every 2 seconds with fresh data

### **Slowloris Attack Script (simple_slowloris.py)**

**What it is:** A Python script that performs a Slowloris denial-of-service attack.

**How it works:**
1. **Opens 50 TCP connections** to the target server
2. **Sends partial HTTP requests** (incomplete headers)
3. **Keeps connections alive** by sending occasional data
4. **Exhausts server resources** so normal users can't connect

**Why it's effective:**
- Uses very little bandwidth (bandwidth is not the bottleneck)
- Consumes server connection slots (the actual resource being attacked)
- Appears as legitimate traffic (hard to detect automatically)
- Simple to implement but effective against unprotected servers

## 📊 What Each Metric Means

### **Response Time**
- **What it measures**: How long it takes the server to respond to a request
- **Normal range**: 100-300ms for a healthy server
- **During attack**: 5000-10000ms (very slow) or timeouts
- **With protection**: 100-500ms (defenses minimize impact)
- **Why it matters**: Shows user experience - high response times = frustrated users

### **Success Rate**
- **What it measures**: Percentage of requests that complete successfully
- **Normal range**: 95-100% for a healthy server
- **During attack**: 20-50% (most requests fail)
- **With protection**: 85-100% (defenses maintain availability)
- **Why it matters**: Shows service availability - low success rate = service outage

### **Total Requests**
- **What it measures**: How many HTTP requests the server has handled
- **Increases over time**: Shows server activity level
- **During attack**: May increase rapidly due to attack traffic
- **Why it matters**: Shows server load and activity patterns

### **Protection Status**
- **🔓 VULNERABLE**: No defenses active - server susceptible to attacks
- **🛡️ PROTECTED**: Defenses enabled - server resistant to attacks
- **Why it matters**: Shows current security posture

## 🛡️ Defense Mechanisms Explained

### **Connection Limits**
- **What it does**: Limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections
- **How it helps**: Prevents attackers from exhausting all connection slots
- **Default setting**: 100 connections maximum
- **Effect**: Attack connections get rejected when limit is reached

### **Request Timeout**
- **What it does**: Automatically closes connections that take too long
- **How it helps**: Prevents slow/incomplete requests from tying up resources
- **Default setting**: 5 seconds maximum per request
- **Effect**: Slowloris connections get terminated automatically

### **Rate Limiting**
- **What it does**: Limits how many requests each IP address can make
- **How it helps**: Prevents single attackers from overwhelming the server
- **Default setting**: 10 requests per IP address
- **Effect**: Attack traffic gets blocked after reaching the limit

### **Why These Work Against Slowloris**
1. **Slowloris relies on keeping many connections open** - connection limits prevent this
2. **Slowloris sends very slow requests** - timeouts terminate these connections
3. **Slowloris typically comes from few IPs** - rate limiting blocks excessive requests
